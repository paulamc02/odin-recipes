    <h1>Fluffy french toast</h1>
    <img src="images/th.jfif" alt="french toast">
    <p>This French toast recipe is different because it uses flour. I have given it to some friends and they've all liked it better than the French toast they usually make!</p>
    <strong>Ingredients</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>   
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>12 thick slices bread</li>
       </ul>
       <strong>Steps to Make It</strong>
       <ol>
        <li>Measure flour into a large mixing bowl. Slowly whisk in the milk. Whisk in the salt, eggs, cinnamon, vanilla extract and sugar until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Soak bread slices in mixture until saturated. Cook bread on each side until golden brown. Serve hot.</li>  
       </ol>
