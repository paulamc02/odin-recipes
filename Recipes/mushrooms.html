<p>This easy appetizer for escargot stuffed mushrooms will make your guests think you worked away in the kitchen for hours. The recipe is a tradition in the Burgundy region of France, which draws a great deal from its German heritage. It also pairs well with the region's excellent and famous wines.</p>
    <p>You can prepare the snails ahead of time, even the day before, and refrigerate them until you're ready to make the mushrooms. As an added benefit, you'll seal in the snails' flavor if you actually freeze them a day or several days before your guests arrive. </p>
